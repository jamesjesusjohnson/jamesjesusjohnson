- 👋 Hi, I’m @jamesjesusjohnson

- 👀 Professionally I’m interested in full stack development right now. Particularly with the goal in mind of finding remote contract work to build my resume.
---  Non-professinoally? Music (singing, guitar playing, songwriting, and performing), video games, staying healthy in the gym, soccer, movies, and entertainment! 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development to help me on my quest to expand my skills from embedded software engineering on microcontrollers and robots
---  to full stack development! I have always enjoyed learning and have recently decided to try my hand with accelerated online courses as a means to further my education
---  without specializing into a masters program (and spending money I'm not willing to part on a direction I'm not entirelyt set on atm).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack development projects. Any and all. I need more experience to make myself more capable in that space.

- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out here! We can exchange more info from there.
